# One-Based-Arithmetic-Convention
Demonstrates the concept of one-based indexing

This repository demonstrates one-based indexing, inspired by Codeforces problem 440C (Find the Number).  The problem highlighted the importance of understanding how indexing works, especially when converting between different systems.  This project explores the concept of one-based indexing, where the first element of a sequence is at index 1, in contrast to the more common zero-based indexing. It provides examples and explanations, making it easier to grasp the nuances of one-based indexing and its implications for problem-solving, particularly in competitive programming contexts like the one presented by 440C.
